<h1>The Best Movies According to Rick</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Major League</h3>
<p>I love the comedy in this movie.</p>
<h3>Top Gun</h3>
<p>This movie inspired me to want to be a pilot but unfortunately at the time of recruitment,
     I did not meet the height requirements.</p>
<h3>Vision Quest</h3>
<p>I more so like the soundtrack for this movie but it is also a motivating movie, IMO.</p>
