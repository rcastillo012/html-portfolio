<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in South Texas and spent the majority of my life in a little town named Donna. Upon graduation from high school,
  I decideed to stay home and attend the local university. I did not finish college but I worked my way up the ranks in a few
  companies that allowed me to be successful in two careers, Training and Management. However, I have wanted to do something more
  and learn something new which is what has led me to this coursework. 
</p>

<p>At the end of 2014 I left a company after having worked there for 14 years and pursued a sales role with a hosting company, 
  Rackspace. However, after 11 months of employment, they began to downsize their workforce and I was impacted by the reduction
  in force. At the end of 2015, I acquired my Realotr's license and began my real estate career which took me through the next 
  two years. In 2017, I was recruited to work for another organization in management and training and progressed within the company
  until my departure in 2024. At the end of 2023, I had already begun to explore Full Stack Development training and I was 
  referred to Udemy by my brother-in-law who is a FSD himself.
</p>

<p>In 2011, I remaarried and my two sons and I moved to San Antonio. Melissa, is an amazing woman who has supported me through my
  ups and downs in life, incuding my career moves. She has two children of her own and we have survived the difficulties of a 
  blended family. We continue to move in the right direction and completing this course and receiving my certification will allow
  us to continue to move forward.
